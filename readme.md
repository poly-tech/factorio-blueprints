# Hello World

## What to expect
Each blueprint should be contained in a **markdown** file (`factory-implementation-description-here.md`) that contains at least a description of what the blueprint is for. It will also contain the exchange string in a codeblock.

## How to contribute
Fork, Make pull request.
